This report gives an overview over the functionalities of the Shape Analyzer application. The code can be found in the CVPR SVN under the project name ShapeAnalyzer. The main purpose of this document is to give an introduction into integrating a new algorithm into the framework and does therefore not contain information about every class. The code is throughly documented though. Instructions how to get the documentation can be found in chapter \ref{subsec:Doxygen}.
