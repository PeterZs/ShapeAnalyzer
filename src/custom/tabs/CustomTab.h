///  \brief Abstract class for Tabs.
///  \details Concrete CustomTab classes have to inherit from this class. Moreover they have to define the event functions onShapeAdd(), onShapeEdit(), onShapeDelete() and onClear() that are called from ShapeAnalyzer if one of these events occurs. Usually these event functions serve the purpose to keep the widgets in the CustomTab classes up-to-data. E.g. a comboBox containing a list of shapes should contain all available shapes. So it has to be updated if a shape is added, deleted or renamed.
